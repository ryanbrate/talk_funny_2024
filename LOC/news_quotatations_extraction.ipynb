MUSA.•Copp\\'s Itfli.The Bnwa Silk Dwii.BY MRS. FHILLirS.Why, Eliza! what a strange choice fora wedding dress Your other dresses arein very good style, and you have a plentyof them cunsilerin^ the changes infasnion—but a brown silk to be marriedin—whoever heard of such a fancy in agirl of eighteen4\\'Tis true, aunt, that my choice mayseem somewhat »ombre, but you knowvery well that I am about to become thewife of a poor mechanic, who depends of.his daily labor for support. As the wifeof such a man, I must necessarily limitmy expenditures to my circumstances, andI have thought it better to purchase something which would be useful for sometime to come, than to consult my\\'nppearance as a »plenlid bride for one short eve*ning—especially as I am to see no strangc«-\\'There is something in that. There ismy Maria\\'s wedding dress. She will never wear it again in the world. She had awhite satin with a lace dress over it. Oh,she did look beautifully I do admire tosee a handsome bride.\\'Yes, it is very well for those who canafford it. But it would be quite absurdfor me to purchase an expensive dress forone, or even a few evenings, when by theexpenditure of half the money, I can procure that which will be serviceable forsome years. But come, put on your bonnet, and step over to our new house. Itis all furnished, at least nil that is finishedI value it inore highly than I should if itwas not so near my mother\\'s.*•There, William has left this small parlor, this sitting-room, and three chambers,to finish, at his leisure, when he is out ofemployment. See how everything is arranged. So handy for my work.\\'\\'You don\\'t say you are going to do yourown work?\\'Certainly I do. There is only one ap-frentice,and I should think it strange ifcould not do it with all ease.\\'My heart, what strange fancies youhave. To be sure, it is well enough ifyou can bring your mind to do it, but thenfolks do so differently now-a-days. Thereis my Maria she has moved into an elegant house, all furnished from top to bottom. She keeps a great girl to do thework, and a little one to wait and tend.—Oh things do go on beautifully, I promiseyou.\\'Her husband is a young lawyer, is henot—is he wealthyOh he is very well off. He does notget much practice, yet, but I dare say hewill, in time. He has a thousand dollarsat interest besides, Maria could not havemarried a mechanic—their hands get sohard and black, and their complexions,especially if they are exposed, get sobrown. I would not wish to hurt yourfeelings, but I do think that, for pride\\'ssake, for the sake of your family, youmight have made a little different choice.\\'4Oh, aunt, excuse my language—I haveyet to learn that a man\\'s honest occupationwhether it produces hard hands or whitesoft hands, whether it gives the cheek abrown or a pale hue, is any dispaiagementto him. You must get acquainted withWilliam, and hear him converse. Youwill not think of hard hands, and his animated, intelligent countenance will drivehis bronzed skin quite out of your head.But aunt, you don\\'t say anything about myfurniture—and you must see my nice closets.\\'\\'Oh your furniture is well enough.—The less then you will have to take careof, you know.\\'Yes, we could not get much furniture.I insisted upon William taking the montywhich my grandfather left me, to pay offa few hundred dollars which he owed forthis place, in order to enable us to beginin the world. We both have such a horror of debt, that we are determined neverto incur any if we can possibly help it.—See what a nifce press for the bed clothesthis is.\\'Why, what a quantity of bed and tablelinen! it is really nice, too. You havemore than my Maria has, I declare.14Yes—I always want an abundance ofsuch things. This drawer is filled withtowels—this is for my ironing sheet andblanket—and this closet contains my tin•nd wooden ware.I declare, Eliza, you are a strangethoughtful child. I must tell you onetiling about Maria, that made us have agood hearty laugh. The Monday morning after she was married, the girl came ito ask where the tubs were, and don\\'t youthink that the child had actually forgottento buy a tub, a clothes-line, or pins Shesaid it never popped into her head. But,la it wasn\\'t strange—she had never beenused to do anything of the kind.\\'1 believe, aunt, I have shown you oil,now. We will go, if you please. I hopeyou will not let my brown dress, or William\\'s brown hands* frighten you awaythis evening?\\'4Oh no But as I must take the stagefor Maria\\'s early in the morning, youmust allow tr.e to retire early.\\'4What fellows these Yankees are forcombining elegance and usefulness,\\' saida southern gentleman to himself as he saton the piazza of the hotel in the town of\\'Sir,\\' said he addressing himself to a vegetable looking man near him,4can you tell me who resides in that elegant cottage, where the grounds are laidout with such taste4Oh that is \\'Squire Bill Thorndike\\'s.You must be a stranger in these parts notto know him.\\'I am, sir and since he seems such aprominent member of society, I should beuappy to know something of his history.\\'\\'Oh, there is nothing remarkable in iit, nothing at all, sir. His father was rf Iman of great learning, but he nearly run!through a fortune in trying to live in styleHe died, and left three boys. Theirmother, who went from the place, was &woman of strong sense. She sold theproperty, paid off all the debts, and had ienough left to buy that little hotue to theleft. It had but two rooms, and there isa garden spot attached to it. Here she iput out her boys to trades. One to a mason, one to a wheel-wright, and this Billto a carpenter. They were mighty smartboys, and settled in distant towns. Billst.«id, however.- He married the widowPefry\\'s daughter. She was as smart a\\'S ia steel-trap she was a right good scholar,and has made an excellent wife. Theyhave got along wonderfully. All wondered how it was. .He did not make better wages than ether men, but somehowthe money increased. It was no mv«teryto ine, for I watched them pretty sharp.You never saw him before lie kept a horse,riding out much for pleasure. No—theyboth pulled one way, and took their pleas-ui\\'e in being sober, industrious, and Useful, and now they reap their fgwatd Inbeing universally respecttd.\\'Why, there ain\\'t a man that has somuch money to let as Squire Thorndike. iand he is never hard and screwing aboutit as some are. He isn\\'t stingy, either.He has laken the two children of one lawyer Willis to bring up, and he does aswell by them as he does by his ovvnf.—Lawyer Willis\\'s wife was a kind of cousin toSquire Thorndike\\'s wife. She was!a dashy, showy gal. Lord! you\\'d ha\\'thought the richest folks upon airth weremarried, when they had the knot tied.Poor fellow he hail a hard time, not with-1standing, to support his lady wife in style.He took to drink and died. I\\'ve heardsay that she turned up her nose\\' at her!cousin\\'s match, but she little thought that Iher boys would be glad to go to that samecousin for a home, while she would beglad to take up with the little house thatSquire Thorndike\\'s mother lived in.\\'Ah, sir,\\' continued the old man, \\'thisis a changing world but to my mind, iffolks would only be prudent and industrious, and give up hankering after thingsbeyond their means, there would be morereal good done, in the world, and fewerchanges.\\'Why Shouldat Than FleeWhen the last pjague raged in London,Lord Craven lived in that part of the citycalled Craven Buildings and to avoid thedanger of this epidemic, his lordship resolv-el to retire to his country seat. Accordingly his coach-and-six were at the door, andbaggage put up, and all things in readinessfor the journey.

       " 'Cain has,” Dr. Holmes finally volunteered; and he was right, for Dihad a great pedigree.Dr. George T. Winston, presidentof the University from 1891 to 1895,always had an illustration, or a sharpsentence of some kind with which todrive home an argument.A very sensitive student, residingin the Old West Building, was toldby an Orange county wood vendorthat one of the campus negro woodchoppers had told him that if he leftan unsold load of wood on the groundnear the Old West Building he (thestudent) would steal it. This insinuation gave the young man a brainstorm. thinking the story over hedecided to send for the wood-chopper.The negro, expecting an order to chopa load of wood, hurried to the roomon the -4th floor; as he entered thestudent threw, with great force anold sword, a family relic, at his head.A quick duck saved him from a severed jugular vein, and the weaponpierced the panel of the door. Without stopping to get a footing thenegro went rolling, sliding, tumblingdown the winding stairway to thefirst floor. He did not slacken hispace until he ran out, and to andthrough the Old South Building. Hewas going to Dr. Winston, but wasafraid to stop, as the student washot-footing it after him with a borrowed pistol in his hand.Hearing the commotion in the hall,Dr. Winston went out, and about thetime he reached the hallway the iratestudent rushed by on the trail of theflying negro, who had taken refugeunder the end steps, facing the library.Before Dr. Winston could catch theyoung fellow he was threatening toempty the gun at the negro throughthe intervening planks.• Dr. Winston rushed up and prevailed on the student to turn overthe gun, and go to his room and calmdown. The negro, seeing the wayclear, left for the tall timbers. Thatnight Dr. Winston sent for the madcap and lectured him.“Now as I see it,” said he in substance, you would have shot to deathan ignorant negro because some fellow told you that the negro said youmight steal his wood if he left itbeneath your room.

Bernard.Atlanta, Ga.M *Closing Scenes With Atlanta Saloons.Our readers in other states will be interested inlearning of the closing scenes of John Barley-corn’slife in Georgia. Generally, the drinking places w6tecrowded during the closing days, but it seemed thatthe drinkers were trying to be quiet and sober upin preparation of the impending drought beforethem. There was little of bitterness on the partof the saloon men, most of them taking their fategood-naturedly, and many of them declaring theirpurpose to stay in Georgia and go into a betterbusiness. One of the most striking and unusualscenes occurred on Decatur street (the street, bythe way, that is thinking of changing its name toget away from its unsavory reputation) and isgraphically described by a reporter in The AtlantaConstitution, as follows:“Red wine and golden booze ran down the gutters of Decatur street yesterday afternoon, and DanGavaghan, saloonkeeper at 96 Decatur street, whowas pouring out the liquor, folded his arms acrosshis breast, looked at the crowd that gazed upon theremarkable scene with wonder-stricken eyes, and exclaimed in his rich Irish brogue:“ ‘This symbolizes the departure of liquor fromGeorgia, and marks the new era in my life, whenI will become a prohibitionist.’“It was in truth a most remarkable scene. Itwas the first time in the history of Decatur streetthat any booze was ever wasted upon its pavementand it would scarcely have been strange if the stoneshad cried out against it.“As the red stream of wine mingled with thegolden stream of booze an old negro said with asigh:“ ‘Lawd er massy, jes’ look at dat good lickerer was tin.’“Dan Gavahan turned upon him and said:“ ‘Old man, go and join the prohibitionists as Iam going to do.’“Dan Gavaghan has always kept one of the mostorderly saloons in the city. He is a good-naturedand light-hearted Irishman, and he has friends bythe score.“Yesterday he went over his stock of liquors andestimated what he thought he could get rid of between that time and 10 o’clock Tuesday right, whenall the liquor houses in the State would close theirdoors to open them no more. After he had takenstock he decided that there was a barrel of wineand a barrel and a half of whiskey which he wouldhave no use for. So, in the afternoon he invited afew of his friends to his saloon to witness the pouring out of the wine and whiskey into the street. Itwas thought that Gavaghan was going to play oneof his Irish jokes, for which he was noted, but hewas very much in earnest. He had a negro to rollthe three barrels onto the sidewalk. The bungswere knocked out and the liquor began to flow downthe gutter.“When the last drop had dripped from the barrels, Gavaghan threw back his shoulders, raised hishead and said:“ ‘I will try to sell what little liquor I have leftbetween now and Tuesday night. I have pouredout what I believed might be a surplus. When mysaloon closes Tuesday night I will step out a prohibitionist. The ceremony just witnessed was intoken of that great event.’ ”This good-natured, philosophic son of Erin, ofcourse, was not fully converted, or he would nothave waited until Tuesday night to quit, but he wasin an encouraging state of mind.9',\n",

The question of protecting Americans at Harput andother inland points is still a perplexing one.

Otherwise, themen marching through a hostile country might be cut to pieces long beforethey readied their destination.SITUATION IN MACEDONIAInsurgents are Everywhere Increasingin Numbers.London, Sept.

He was very poor.“One more baby arrived. Fo the congregation got up what is knowui in tlieSouth as a pounding. The idea is thateverybody gives a pound of something tostock up the family food supply.

C. Turner, city electrician, of Atlanta, who installedGeorgia’s first electric chair, appliedthe high voltage charge for sixtythree seconds, and, three minuteslater, physicians’ examined the negro and pronounced him dead.There was some criticism amongthe spectators of the delay in preparing the negro for the electrocution, although all agreed that thisactual death was more humane thanthe gallows.Judge R. E. Davidson of the prisoncommission and Representative R.O. Perkins of Muscogee county, author of the electric chair bill, statedfollowing the execution that theyconsidered this new method a greatimprovement over the old.Brought from CellHinton, under heavy guard, wasbrought from the temporary deathcell, in the rear of the executivebuilding to the death chamber.He walked erectly and promptlysat in the chair.Mr. Turner, assisted by B. 11.Dunaway, superintendent of theprison, strapped the negro firmly tothe chair, first his arms, then hislegs. Last a heavy band was drawntightly across his chest.After having been secured to thechair the head electrode, which resembles a football headgear, wasclasped tightly on his head by meansof a tightly drawn leather cord under his chin. At this juncture theprisoner complained that it was tootight and it was loosened a bit.During this time the salt water,contained in a sponge inside the copper helmet, ran down the negro’slace and Dr. H. C. Emory, pastor ofthe Methodist church in Milledgeville, came forward and held a handkerchief to the man’s eyes.Then Mr. Turner applied the otherelectrode to the negro’s bare rightleg.Stepping back /rom the chair hesurveyed the apparatus carefully andmade a few minor adjustments.Previously, the electrician hadcalled the powerhouse at Milledgeville on a telephone installed in thedeath chamber, and instructed theengineer to run the current to voltage of 1,900 and then let it drop to600 at a given signal, and to ]et thecurrent fluctuate until told to cease.The electrician then stepped to lheJSveijr ParentLoves his childrenTonight, daddy, take a package of WRIGLEY’S tothe kiddies.

Compton,prison physician, Dr. Tom M. Hill,of Milledgeville, and Dr. O. C. Gibson, of Macon, listened to the prisoner’s heart and pronounced himdead.Death InstantaneousFurther examination revealed thatthe skin had been burned at nopoint and the physicians expressedthe opinion that the negro was unconscious in a fraction of a secondafter the charge passed to his headand leg. After pronouncement ofdeath, the body was taken from thechair and placed in the custody ofRobert McCurdy, warden of the De-Kalb county convict camp, and L.M. Rogers and W. A. Rogers, De-Kalb county policemen. They wereto turn the body over to a localundertaker wr shipment to DeKalbcounty for interment.During the time the electric chairwas in actual use all plants in andaround Milledgeville suspended operation so as to let more power beconverted to the death chamber andresidents of Milledgeville said household lights practically went out.Before going to the death chamber, Hinton was questioned byRepresentative Perkins who askedhim if he had rather die by the gallows than in the manner in whichhe was sentenced to expiate hiscrime.“I’m glad they are going to saveme from being hanged with a rope,”the negro said.

All are charged withillegal sale of liquors.Closely following upon the heels ofthe raid at Sawtelle, Mr. Fleming, incompany with Constable De la Monteand Deputy Thomas, visited the FourMile house on the San Fernando roadand arrested Charles Melerio on thecharge of illegally selling liquor. Alarge quantity of beer, wine and whisky was also confiscated at this resort and taken in charge by the officers.Many Complaints ReceivedThe raid upon the Sawtelle resortswas the result of continual complaintby Governor La Grange of the Soldiers\\'home, who informed the district attorney that liquor was being sold withinthe limits of one and one-half milesof the home, contrary to the law.Complaints from the management ofthe Soldiers\\' home have been numerous during the last year and In thattime several shooting and stabbing affrays have occurred, which the management of the home believes wouldhave been avoided had the offendersrot been drunk with liquors bought atblind pigs. Because of this state of affairs the management of the home hasbeen constantly vigilant in aiding theofficers to suppress the illegal traffic.Melerio, who was arrested at theFour Mil« house, was convicted August7 in Justic Young\\'s court of Illegallyselling liquors and was fined $200.While the officers were in Melerio\\'splace, five men were detected in therear room drinking and as the officersstarted out of the house, an old negrowalked in and cooly called for a•dram.\"Not knowing that the visitors wereofficers and upon Being refused a drink,the old negro said that he was unableto understand why he couldn\\'t have adrink at once, as he had always been agood customer and had bought hisdrink regularly every day for sometime.T',\n",

We hadheld no revival meeting, but conversions andbaptisms were frequent. I set apart a portionof two afternoons a week to meet inquirers forreligious conversation and many came to talkwith me.One day Mrs. Baker, a married lady of abouttwenty-five years, came to my study seeminglyvery much distressed. After a few minutes’conversation, she said—and her voice trembbled—“Pastor, I have come on a somewhat saderrand; I have come to ask you to take myname off the church book.”“Well, Sister Baker.” I answered, “I amglad to tell you that I have no authority to takeyour name off of our list of membership. Youwere taken in by vote of the church and canonly go out by vote of the church. The pastorhas no authority in such matters. That is thesafeguard of every Baptist church from thetyfany of priestcraft. But. why, let me ask.do you wish your name taken off the churchbook?”With considerable emotion she answered—“ Because. I do not think I am a Christian.I have come to fear I was never converted.”“Possibly that may be so. Sister Baker, butI think I see evidence enough even now, tomake me doubt it. How old were you whenyou joined the church?”“About fourteen.”“Were you quite satisfied then that youwere converted?”“O. yes; I had no doubt of it then, and forthree or four years I lived in the enjoymentof religion, and the service of Christ was a realpleasure.”“Three or four years —that would bring youto seventeen or eighteen years of age.- Wasthere any change in your life then —did therecome into your life any new element thatworked a change in your religious habits?”“Yes,” —with slight embarrassment—“l began to go into society, and met Mr. Baker, andwe became friends, then lovers and finally engaged, and erelong, married. Mr. Baker wasa perfectly moral, upright and honorable man,and is one of the kindest and best husbands;but he is not a Christian, and before our marriage, was much more a man of the world thanhe is now. He cares much less for those sinful pleasures.”“Principles fit a man anywhere.\"“There is a hope for a man as long as heholds to a high ideal.

Tne first class thinktoward expression in words andto this class belong our poets, our orators and our public speakers.The second class think toward expression in deeds and to this class beiong bur architects, our sculptors, ourmanagers of great business enterprisesand our leading generals. I do notknow what right we have to measurethe greatness of the one by the greatness of the other.Never before in my life, boys, did Irealize the horrors of slavery. Ithought what logic to come from thelips of a man and that man a slave,owned by somebody else, and lookingnot to God for his master but to someman.Now the life of a farmer is not thelife of a talker, but it must be the lifeof a thinker and therefore we mustplace him in the category of men whothink towards expressions in deeds.In consequence of this he may beclassed among the painters, tho sculptors, the architects, the managers ofgreat enterprises and the leading generals, for he is dealing with a godlikescience and he is the only vicar generalGod has ever made.It is no great trick to be a banker, ora lawyer, or a merchant, because thesemen are only dealing with the laws ofmen\\'s deviseraent All this man needsto learn is what that man. behind himknew, but the farmer has to interpretthe laws that God has devised, and itis. a big thing to interpret God Almighty. The life of the hog is just as mysterious as the life of the Statesman, andmany times more useful. The mysteryof life is just as great in the cockroachas in the mammoth.

However, even ifthe celestial visitor does bump intothe earth it will cause no catastrophe, Dr. Crommelin says. Peoplegenerally would not even notice, itand as for the astronomers, they 1would really welcome a collision because it would give them an opportunity of finding out what cometsare made of.The comet is known as the PonsWinnecke, first named in 1819. Itbecomes visible from the earthevery five and three-quarter years.Pons-Winnecke is different fromthe usual comet in that instead ofhaving a tail like most others it hasa trail of meteors 500 or 600 mileslong. When .near the earth thiscomet travels at the rate of, twentyfour miles a second.A new radio station in Francewhen complete will easily work withall stations in the world.RosenbergFour StoresAbbeYou will ]Ouir maa greNEVThe RosenKRAMER WILL HUNTMOONSHINE STILLSGreenville, Feb. 22.?John F.Kramer, federal prohibition commissioner who, arrived here today,will tomrorow go to the mountainous section of the county on asearch for moonshine stills accompanied by W.

The Yankee character \"Eb\"Scowcnhove, as presented by the inimitable comedian, John Thompson, in\"The Funny i*Wlow of New York,\" isguaranteed to ;..akcyou laugh, whetheryou wish to laugh or not.If a person were afllicted with therheumatism gout and neuralgia, theywould have to forget their pains andlaugh at this character.As soon as \"Eb\" makes his appearance he tells the audience that he haslost his cow, has been kicked by a muleand a few other misfortunes that havehappened to him. After awhile he?*ees the piano, and has something tosay about it. No one being present toplay it, he decides to play it himself;so, after singing a comic song, heamuses himself by playing \"Turkey inthe Straw,\" in rag time. The playingof this tune has such an effect on himthat he cannot resist the temptation todance, although he weighs nearly 300pounds. While dancing his legs beginto get short; the audience notice thisand begin to laugh; the longer hedances the shorter his legs become,and the shorter bis legs become thelouder the audience laugh, and as hislegs arc becoming shorter every minutethe laughter grows louder, and finally,when his legs become so short thatthey disappear altogether, then thelaughter turns to howling, and whenthe audience are all howling togetherthey make such a noise that sometimesthey can be heard outside of the theatrefor a three quarter of a mile.The other nine characters are just asfunny. Mr. Thompson will appear atthe Laurens opera houso for one nighton Wednesday, September 26tb. Theadmission will be 25, 35 and 50 cents.MR.

       " ' Theterms \"sound money,\" \"honest money,etc., are used to appeal to and placatethe moral sense and elude investigation.The term \"best money\" appeals to thepride and aspirations cf our people,who desire the best of everything thatis obtainable.But the advocates of the gold standard do not stop when they have turnedto an account these higher attributesof human nature but go further andapply their artifices to the lower andbaser passions as well. The argumentthat the movement for the restorationof silver as a monev metal is in the interest of silver mine owners is calculated to excite envy, the most perverseand ignoble trait of human nature,against the owners of silver mines onthe ground that his product is beingespecially favored by law, suggestingto the mind at the same time that thebalance of society is being injured inorder that the owners of .silver minesmay make additional profit. In thisconnection, however, they forget to remind the people that geld mines arethe private property of individuals aswell as silver mines. In making thisappeal to the baser passions an insultis offered to the intelligence of the people, the presumption in the mind of the iparty advancing the argument beingthat the lower or baser passions are somuch stronger than our intelligencethat the deceptive argument made willhave the effect of controlling ouractions in favor of a policy that benefitsthem while it injures the balance of society.They do not remind us in this connection that gold and silver alike have enjoyed the same rights and privileges asmoney metals from time immemorial,and have constituted the world\\'s sourceof money supply. They do not suggestto us that when the silver miner is disci iminated against by having his product excluded from the mints that thegold miners\\' product is enhanced thereby, and that so far as the question applies to mine owners it is between theowners of gold mines and the ownersof silver mines, as the government orpeople, in their collective capacity, arenot the owner of either the cold or silver mines. They do not make any complaint because the silver miner has beendeprived of the privilege that his product has enjoyed from time immemorial,because this might sucsrest that theowners of gold mines were receivingunmerited favor at the hands of thegovernment.So far as the miners are concerned,the balance of society who are not engaged in mining, have no special interest in the question, because the goldmines and the silver mines alike are atthe present time as they ever have beenin this country, private property. Thequestion that affects the people is oneof immeasurably greater importancethan discriminating in favor of oragainst the product of any individualclass in the nation. It is a question ofmoney supply which affects the prosperity of the entire country, the valueof our property, our ability to paydebts and taxes, and for our laboringpeople involves qnestions of continuedemployment at remunerative wages.The appeal that come3 to lis in theshape of all these ingenious and sophistical arguments emanates from thosewho own the great debts r.gainst thenations and people of the world. Theycre interested to give money a largerpower to command other things. Theyunderstand the way to do this is tomake money scarce, and in order tomake money scarce they have concentrated their efforts throughout theworld to procure the outlawing of silver and the closing of the mints againstit. thus restricting the money supply togold alone.During the 25 years since the work ofdemonetization was started the goldof the world has doubled in value, thatis. every ounce of gold in existence willrow exc hange for double the amount ofother things in general that it would in1S73. Therefore all the debts that existed in 1573 are now worth twice asmuch to their present holders as theywere at that time. The property of thepeople measured against money to paydebts is at the present time worth onlyone-half as much as it was in 1S7.1. Thusthrough the force of law closing themints against silver the fund-holdingclasses have doubled their wealth andplundered scciety to the amount cf thegain they have thus made.This is not all, however. During thisprocess of falling prices bankruptcyhas overtaken the industrious andbrought ruin to the most worthy classof our people. The last SO years havebeen years of strikes, lockouts, andlabor riots, and are marked by a concentration of wealth unparalleled in thehistory of the world, until to-day graveand serious problems, unknown andunheard cf before, are at our thresholdfor settlement. -The questions of monopoly and trusts, and the powerful combinations of capital, menace populargovernment and the rights of man inthe United States, the very citadel ofhlerty.

Judgtdby this true test, it is almost needletsto say that the world has never yetseen perfectly honest money. By suchtest money has fluctuated in its degrees of honesty with the fluctuatingyield of the precious metals of whichit has been composed. As this yield hasincreased or diminished, prices haverisen or fallen with the fluctuatious inthe supply of money in generalcirculation, and the discharge ofdebts, payable in the future, hasgrown more or less burdensome to debtors, and more or less gainful to creditors, in proportion to this yield. Hencea circulating medium composed of bothgold and silver money is more honestthan one composed of gold alone, because the supply of both metals is lessliable to fluctuations than that of oneof them only, since a diminution in theyield of one metal has generally beencompensated for by an increased yieldof the other.Thus, until silver was demonetized,the supply of money was automatic inits operation. It depended upon causesthat were beyond the control of themoney changers. The effects of an increase or diminution of the preciousmetals were therefore diffused over theworld, and all changes in the generallevel of prices were slowly spread overconsiderable periods of time, so thatbusiness of all kinds gradually adapteditself to such changes, without suddenand great distress to the people. Thiscondition tended strongly to cause ageneral diffusion of property amongthe industrious and provident, and allcf the achievements of modern civilization on the line of the betterment ofmankind have been wrought out undersuch condition.Less than 33 vears ago the moneychangers and bondholders having become dissatisfied with the profit derived from the use of their capital invested in money and interest-bearingsecurities of every kind, concluded todouble the purchasing power of suchcapital by destroying, through legislation, the use of silver by the great commercial nations. They thus doubledthe purchasing power of gold, whichthe nature of their business enablesthem without expense to monopolize atwill. By this means the automatic operation of money upon the world\\'s levelof prices was destroyed, and pricesplaced under the almost complete control of artificial influences. Thu areall natural trade movements which depend upon the unimpeded operation ofthe law of supply and demand prevented, and the law itself overthrown. Bythis artificial control over prices, exercised through their control over thevolume and distribution of monev, themoney changers and their allied trustshave entrenched themselves betweenthe producer and consumer, not asIgitimate middlemen, to facilitate commerce, but as autocrats dictating toproducer and consumer alike the priceat which the one shall sell and theother buy all the products of labor andproperty.The gold monopoly is now the breeding mother of all monopolies. All othertrusts followed swiftly upon the heelscf the formation of the gold trust. Thesuccessful operation of all other monopolies depends upon their control of, orassistance received from, one or morebanks clamorous for gold money only.A free line of \"accommodations\" flowreadily from the gold monopoly, represented by the banks to all othermonopolies. The banks know that suchdebtors hold certain industries in theirgrip, and that their business will, therefore, be successful, and their bank accommodations secure. But with thoseoutside the pale of any trust, the banksdeal at arm\\'s length and with heavyhand. Not until the gold trust is overthrown will it be possible to overthrowits aiders and abettors. As they standunited together, so will they fall together, or not at all. Hon. W. II.

R,WHAT ANOTIIEr. CORBESrOJfDENT SAYS!Correspondence Cincinnati Enquirer.As for the colored voters, reliance is hadon their race prejudices, to make them votethe Grant ticket. They arc thoroughlydrilled in Union League Clubs and beingextremely ignorant and credulous can bemade to believe that u Grant is not sustained by them they will be again put backinto slavery, ror a report to be circulatedagainst a colored man that he has goneback on Ms race is his death warrant unlesshe can prove it to be false. \"What! yougwine back on de race?\" unless promptlyselUedTh the negative insures the death ofthe offender.Then the registration is in the hands andunder the control of the friends of theWashington Administration. The Governor is a Grant man, and is the head of theRegistrationjioards. Whoever has controlof the registration lists virtually controlsthe election, when the Governor standsready to sanction frauds, ani already aresome barefaced frauds being perpetrated bytne urani registering onicers.But possibly more than anything else thatwill aid tho Wasliington Administration incarrying the State will be tho importationof colored voters from South Carolina andVirginia. The money that will be spentamong tha colored voters will be mostlyspent in that direction. Pipe-laying, as itused to be called, will be extensively practiced, and the population of the State\\'is rapidly increasing by means of imported colored men from adjoining States.Democrats are fully aware of the difficulties in the way of success on the first ofAugust, but It is generally admitted byuectocraia anu urani men tnak tne carrying of the State next week does not Insurethe fatate for Grant In November. Now.there being no other State canvass on hand.all the money, influence and energies ofine n asmngiou Aommistrauon are Drougntto bear in tbis btate, for it Is necessary tosncceeu ai ims oiaie election to enable theWashington Amlnistration to keep its headabove water until the October elections. Atthe November election there will be toomany doubtful State3 to be cared for, forthe same exertions to be used here in November that are now bestowed on NorthCarolina.The worst feature of the canvass that Ican see is that the chasm between the whiteand black races at the South is beingwiuuuea, so mai inenaiv nanus cannot begrasped over it. The whites, to a man almost, and the blacks, to a man almost, occupy different sides, and they are the oneswno suould be able always to crasD thebands of the other, for they are to liveneighbors, occupants of tho same soil. Thepoliticians of the Grant party and its car-pet-Dagrers are advising against the closingof the gap, and counseling the colored people to not give their confidence to then-white neighbors. Thus the hatreds betweenthe two are to he continued and strengthened to enable outside parties to keep themselves in office at Washington; all of whichI regard as very bad policy for the coloredpeople who intend to live in the SouthernStates.But all such considerations will have noforce at this time. lTho bosses\\' eyes amsot,\" as a negro said, and, so far as thepresent election is concerned, Mr. ',\n",

LANDRY:In announcing myself as a candidatefor Judge, subject to the ensuing Democratic Pnimary to be held for such nominations, I desire to say that it is thelast time I shall be a candidate for anyoffice in the gift of the people. I feelsincerely grateful to them for the manyevidences of their esteem and confidencein the past, and in again soliciting itscontinuance, I wish to say further that\\'I think they have a right to know howI .stBt1 as to various matters in whichmany of them feel a deep interest.In regald to the division of the parish,I entertain now as I have for yearspast, the opinion that the people of theWestern part of the parish are entitledto be organized into a parish for themselves, and I have never thrown anyobstacle in their way, nor do I intend todo so; nor, on the other hand, haveIever done anything, or said anything,to promote it. I have uniformly beenneutral in the matter, and intend to remain so, believing as I do that my position as Judge requires that I shouldkeep myself free from the bitternessthat always grows out of such issues.I am but human, and should I activelytake either side I would inevitablymake enemies and impair the conildence of many persons in my impartiality as a Judge, a result I think it myduty to avoid. I need hardly add thattaking sides on the question could notmake me a good Judge, nor would myrefusal to take sides make me a badJudge, that being a question of personalmerit only. I shall, hence neithermake, nor enter into any combinationwith any person or persons in that matter, with the hope of securing votes formyself or for any one else, or for anypurpose.Another question of frequent inquiry,is whom do I intend to support for District Attorney. I shall be fully asfrank in this as in other respects, and Iam doing this to put an end to misapprehension and I fear, in some cases,misrepresentation.I do not intend to take sides in thiscontest at all, and I have never uttereda word, either against or in behalf, ofany candidate for that office. Both candidates have my friendship and esteefi~and I have no reason to antagonizeeither of them, and shall not do so. Mybelief and opinion is that they, as wellas myself, should go before the peopleupon our personal merits and fitnessalone, for the othfice we respectivelyseek, that bein5 the object and purposeof the Primary law. And I believe, ifthe voter is left to make his own choicewithout secret combinations andselfish alliances, he will make a wiserand better choice then would be thecase otherwise.So far as I am concerned, I shall leaveit to their free and untrammelledchoice whether or not I am to continueas their Judge for another term. I shallmake no entangling alliances whateverand should I be found worthy of election for the last time, I would be ungrateful indeed not to thank themearnestly and sincerely for such a finalexpression of their confidence in myability to discharge the duties of thathigh office. On the other hand, shouldit be otherwi\\'e, I assure them that Ishall not whine and complain, but willbow to their wishes.Finally., I believe it should be left to\\'the great body of the voters alone, todetermine for themselves whether theywant, the division of the parish, orwh.flhevr ;hey want M.r. Sandoz or MirHarlaind for District Attorney, or my.:kef, or another for Judge, and I shallnot attomot to dictate what they shoulddo in these matters.I im not, and should not be held re*ponsible for what others may door say.Re. - t CttUlly, E.

But the ungarnlsheddish Is almost as unappetizing.Summer garnishes should always befresh, crlBp and dainty. Watercress,fresh parsley, lettuce heart leavee, capers and small radishes, crisp andcold, all form appropriate and appetising garnishee for meat, fish and vegetable dishes.Another way of garnishing is bycombining two dishes. For instance,if hashed brown potatoes are to beserved with a hash of lamb and peppers, place the meat hash in the center of the dish and arrange the potatoes neatly about it Creamed fishcan be piled in the center of the platter, creamy mashed potatoes can bearranged about It, and the whole canbe browned In the oven—with a fewbuttered bread crumbs sprinkled overthe dish—for 10 to 16 minutes. Baconcan be used as a garnish to liver orpoached or fried eggs. It should bebroiled, crisp and dry, and should beneatly put on the serving dish; nothing Is more unsightly than greasy,limp, half-cooked bacon piled hit ormiss on a dish.rAUMIMu I Ht rlUNIU HAoKt ISmall Amount of Care Irv-Thls MakesAll the Difference When Supperla Served.Almost as much depends on thepacking of the picnic basket as on themaking of the picnic fare. For a moderate amount of money many thingscan be bought to make the work ofpacking the basket easy. Thermos bottles for cream and milk, special sandwich boxes, paper sets of doilies, napkins and tablecloths, paper plates andsaucers to match and paper cups canall be bought.A menu for a hearty cold picnic supper is as follows: Cold broiled chicken, stuffed tomatoes with lettuce andmayonnaise, currant Jelly, butteredrolls, Iced coffee and strawberry orraspberry shortcake. Each stuffed tomato can be wrapped in a damp cloth,the chicken can be packed in a paperlined box and the rolls can be carriedin a box or basket. The two layers ofcake for the shortcake can be carefully wrapped in a napkin. The berries,prepared with sugar, cream to whip forthe shortcake and to use for the coffee, the coffee Itself and the mayonnaise dressing for the salad can all becarried in fruit Jars; although thecream, if there is a thermos bottle,had better be carried in thatDo You Need Psrnlture Polish?This recipe for polish for woodfurniture will, no doubt, be appreciated. Take three ounces of wax, equalparts of yellow and white,\\' shave itvery fine, then mix it with a gillof turpentine, and let it remain f(#24 hours. Scrape half an ounce ofcastile soap and boil it in a gill ofwater. Then vut these ingredientstogether, stirring them with a pieceul buck, wnen corn, me mixture isready for use, but must be kept in acarefully closed jar.

It should be just stiffenough to roll out (Stiff soda biscuitsare always failures.) Roll out half aninch thick with a few rapid strokes,cut out, bake at once in a quick ovenTo Clean Light Woolens.Make a mixture of cornmeal, a handful of borax and half a cake of magnesia. Mix this dry, and scrub thegoods with it To clean wool shawls,jackets, etc., sprinkle the mixture overthe garment, place Inside a sheet folded several times, and beat lightly.

TUTTLE.)There is probably no Investmentthe fanner can make that will pay thepercentage of profit that a solderingkit will. Reduced to Its lowest termsa coffer can be bought for 25 cents,acid 5 cents, solder wire 10 cents.It will be better, however, to buytwo coffers, one and one-half or threequarter pounds each, which should notcost more than 76 centB per pair. Using two one can be heating whilethe other is in use.The acid is muriatic in which dissolve a little zinc. For the beginnerprobably it will be found handler touse the solder In the form of a wire,though later a bar will be found tobe convenient.Having secured the outfit \\'tho firstthing is to \"tin” the point. To dothis file the beveled surfaces downhriffht And boat In fho otnvo ( fabgasoline, wood or coal) )until It la hotenough to melt the solder.Then with a small, flat stick smearthe surfaces with the acid and rubthe end of the solder over them.If It does not melt freely get thecoffer hotter. After tinning the pointtry not to get It so hot it will burnoff; in case you do, however, retin bythe same process.If the (inning is not on the solderwill not pick up solder nor melt itfreely.For a starter let us try a leaky pan.Sandpaper, or scrape clean around thehole and smear with acid. Take thecoffer properly heated and set thepoint on the hole, applying the solder.Watch and see it run freely (you cantell at once if it fuses properly) andremove the coffer.If the coffer gets cold take the otherone which should also be in the fire.The work may be done equally wellInside the pan.If the hole is too large cut a smallpiece of tin and put over the hole,having first used the acid on bothpatch and pan. Put the coffer on topof the patch and when sufficiently hotrun the end of the solder wire aroundthe patch. It should melt readily.Hold down with the coffer or stick until the solder runs.This briefly, is the problem of soldering. Other applications will bereadily solved once one is familiarwith the tools.Most metals can be soldered, nol,however, cast iron or aluminum. Inthe case of galvanized iron or zinc,use muriatic acid straight. As moreskill is acquired you will be able topick up solder on the point of thecoffer when you can buy solder by thebar.WORKING THE LISTED CORNSled Shown In Illustration May BeUsed for First Time Over—Useful and Practical.The illustration shows a home-madesled which we use for working listedcorn the first time over.

This sled can be made in afew minutes and you will find it bothuseful and practical.Best Time to 8ell.It is generally conceded that thebest time to sell chickens is from thefirst of January to the first of November. Every one seems to want tosell during November and December,gnd consequently the market is always overstocked at that time.Sprague says if possible chickensshould be marketed before the firstof November, and if not they shouldbe held until after the holiday inorder that the best prices may besecured. This of course refers onlyto sending to an open market, anddoes not apply to any private custom.Protect From Flies.Remember that it takes as muchenergy and feed to fight flies as itdoes to grow a calf. Then will it notpay to, cut out the flies by giving thecalves access to a dark stable or shed,and also apply a little “fly dope.’’You may rest assured that they willgrow and lay on flesh twice as fastfrom now on if they are afforded ameans of thus protecting themselvesthan they otherwise could possibly do.Bush Fruit Easy to Raise.Blackberries and raspberries willthrive on almost any Boil and undera variety of conditions. It is comparatively eaBy to propagate them, sothere is little excuse for not having a small garden patch of this finefruit.Keep Good Laying, Hen.A good laying hen should never besacrificed so long as she can be usedfor breeding purposes and the selection of such hens for breeders wouldsoon result in the improvement of theflock. • .Bad Practices.Too much forcing in a young pig itsure to pause a breaking down in thefeet, and too free a use of corn is aptto produce the same resultName Is No Aid.It is the Individual cow in thedairy that helps along with theprofits, and not the name.Mistake in Hogs.Mistakes in pig feeding are costlyIn the short life of the pig there Ja-little time 19 correct mistakes -HOUDAN FOWL IS ECONOMICNot Only lo It Excellent Table Breed,but la Also Good Layer of Eggsand Noneltter.Of all the French breeda the Houdanla undoubtedly the moat economic.Not only la It a good table breedwhen judged by the quality of Itsflesh, but It la an excellent layer ofgood slsed white eggs, and Is a nonsitter. Newer breeds of fowls whichhave been Introduced during recentyears have rather overshadowed It,but few if any of these can lay claimto superiority over It in utility points.No doubt the crest had much to dowith the decline suffered by the Houdan, many poultry keepers not caringfor crested fowls, owing to the factthat in wet weather the head adornments got saturated and caused coldsamong the birds, but a litle consideration for them in the wny of shelterduring periods of rain woi Id have minimized any prejudice against themconcerning wet crests and colds. Whenthe Houdan stood high In popular favor there were fewer or no scratchlnging sheds In existence, and they eitherhad to face the weather, when suchwas Inclement, or idle about the interior of the roosting house, and nowonder many birds, and especially thecrested ones, often got saturated withrain and caught cold and contractedroup. Today every well arrangedpoultry yard has its scratching-shedsor day shelters to which the fowls canresort in bad weather, and on thataccount the Houdan might be given abetter position than it now occupiesamong utility poultry. The crest ofthe Houdan is an advantage ratherthan a disadvantage, Inasmuch as itguards the head of thel bird againstthe severest frost during the wintertime, and thus it improves the fowlas a winter layer. Rightly bred, fedand sheltered the Houdan is a goodwinter egg producer.TO DESTROY NOXIOUS WEEDS8uscaas of Rotation of CultivatedCrops Depends Entirely Upon Persistency of Cultivation.A good system of rotation, that includes cultivated crops, offers the bestmeans of combating the commonweeds; but Its success Is almost enField Dodder.tirely dependent upon the manner andpersistency with which the soil is cultivated. To insure reasonable success, the disk and the harrow shouldbe used frequently while the weedsare still small, and the cropB whilegrowing should be given frequent cultivation.Fortunately, the same tillage operations that are used in putting the soilIn a condition to receive and conserverainfall, to prepare the seed-bed andto liberate plant food, are likewiseuseful In combating weeds.To Avoid the Runty Pig.Runty pigs stand a poor show atthe feeding trough with a bunch oftheir husky brothers and sisters. Asthey are crowded out of place naturally they do not get enough to eat tokeep them growing, and they stayrunty.A trough arranged with V-shapedpartitions set strongly in the troughwould give the little fellowB an equalshow with the big ones, and theweaker ones would get their share offood. A handy man can make sucha trough arrangement in an hour orso, and even the growth of his pigswould more than pay for his trouble.Blanching Celery.With celery for early use this maybegin as soon as the stalks are a foothigh or even less. The first work isin getting the stalkB in an erect position, gathering them together with thehand and packing a small quantity ofearth around the base to hold themupright.In a few days a little more earthmay be added, always doing thework while the plants are dry, beingcareful to hold the leaves or stalkstogether so that none of the earthwill go between the stalks; also being careful not to put the earth abovethe growing heart of the plant.Qoose at Michaelmas.Eating goose at Michaelmas was avery early custom in England as farback as the tenth year of the reignof Edward IV. (1471). John do laHaves was bound to render to WI111am Bamaby, lord of Lastres, in thecounty of Hereford, for a part of thedemesne land, one goose fit for thelord’s dinner on the feast of St. Michael, the archangel.Valuable Weed Eradicator.Probably no animal is so valuable asa weed eradicator as the sheep. Theynot only eat a large variety of weedsand grasses, but they masticate sothoroughly that almost all the seedsare destroyed or digested, and do notsprout from the manure.Dehorning Calves.It is all right to dehorn calves assoon as the button starts, either withcaustic potash or any of the prepareddehorning compounds.Sow to Discard.If the sow is in the habit of losingher litter, It is the height of folly tocontinue breeding her, as she hassome Inherited ailment.\\\\ •Out of Fashion.Harrowing corn when small seemsto be going ont of fashion more andmore each year.Important Consideration.The ability of an ewe to properlynourish her lamb is one of the mostimportant conalderat\\'ons in selectingbreeding stock.Ssours Good-Sized Lambs.It is generally conceded that if theewes are in good condition at matingtime a larger proportion of twin lamb**can be secured.Silo Is Essential.It Is now an admitted fact thai«?**? farmer ought, to own a aHnExplaining the Situation.Down in the Red river valley section of Louisiana there is a planter,a veteran of the Civil war, who isnoted for his profane vocabulary.Not ldng since he married, andeverything sailed along nicely for afew days.

Their commands werecamped on either side of Lick creek, ?j large, slugiri^h stream, too deep to toldand too shallow for a ferry boat; butthere a bridge spanned the stream, forconvenience of the traveling public.! Etch of them guarded this bridge, thatcommunication should go neither north| or south as the railroad track had beenbroken up months before. Afiwr fight: ing each other for several months, andcontesting the point as to which shouldhold the bri<)ge, they agreed to fight aduel, the conquerer to hold the bridgeundisputed for the time being. Jonesgave the challenge, and Fry accepted.The teniio were that they bhonld tightwith navy pistols at twenty yards ap:.rtdeliberately walked forward each other,and firing until the last chamber oftheir pistols were discharged, u.ilessone or the other tell before all the discharges were made.

And then we adviso it to trv if it can insert its mctaphysical scissors between transportation by lamand transportation by water, and separatethe constitutional power which applies tothe one from that which relates to theother. There is no such dividing linethere is no stopping place in the Constitution between prescribing the price of freightsbetween New lork and I\\'hiladelphia byrail and prescribing the price of freightsbetween Now York and Liverpool by watcr, If the grant of power to regulatecommerce includes one, it inoludes bothnice it is the very same grant in the verysame language.Lven it the fatal constitutional objectioncould be got over and the power were conceded, a regulation of the price of throughfreights between the West and the Eastwould not afford the relief asked for by thefarmers, The oppressiou they chiefly coni-Slain of is that practiced within their owntatos, which makes it in some cases moreexpensive to get their grain conveyed tothe great shipping points than all the restof the way to New York. Between thegreat Western grain marts and the Atlantic seaboard, freights are kept down by competition, especially during the season ofnavigation ; but within the States there isgenerally no choice of routes, and it iswhere the railroads posess this local monopoly that they practice their worst extortions.

The capacity of the schoolwas formerly limited to about fifty, butas so many boys who were entitled to aplace were sent to the school the managers of the institution stretched thespace and crowded in an additional fifteen.There are now In Birmingham, according to Judge Feagin, who is probably better informed than any one else in thecity, at least twenty-five boys who arefit subjects for the Industrial school, orthe jail, but who are not sent to eitherplace. It is feared tha£ if these boys*are sent to the jails that they will be1 come hardened criminals, and there is notroom for them in the Industrial school,therefore Judge Feagin has turned looseseveral of them who were convicted ofcrimes in his court on promise of goodbehavior.The bill providing for a large appropriation will probably be introduced withinthe next few days and it 1b believed itwill be passed by a safe majority. Thetext of the bill has never been madepublic, but it calls for a large sum olmoney and also asks that the managingboard of the school shall have increasedpowers.JIM WEBB TALKSCALMLYOF DEATHWas Not Surprised at SupremeCourt’s DecisionREADS HIS BIBLE DAILY8layer of Policeman Walton Was Baptized By Sprinkling, But HeNow Desires to B*Immersed.“The third chapter of John is my wholefaith, and I often read that chapter ofthe Bible where it tells of Nieodemus andthat a man can be born again and besaved,” said the negro Jim Webb yesterday afternoon when he was told that Tiemust die for killing Policeman W.

Folsom ofLong Beach, Mr. Fleming swoopeddown upon Sawtelle yesterday afternoon and arrested Horatio Bolster, C.Mallory and Mallory\\'s assistant, Brown.Three barrels of beer, a jug of whisky and a large quantity of small flasksof whisky of the 25 and 50 cent sizeswere found concealed under the counterin Mallory\\'s pool room and were confiscated by the officers and will beused as evidence against the prisoners.The prisoners were sent to LongBeach In company with Lynn and Folsom and four complaints were lodgedagainst Mallory, four were madeagainst Brown and one was madeagainst Bolster. All are charged withillegal sale of liquors.Closely following upon the heels ofthe raid at Sawtelle, Mr. Fleming, incompany with Constable De la Monteand Deputy Thomas, visited the FourMile house on the San Fernando roadand arrested Charles Melerio on thecharge of illegally selling liquor. Alarge quantity of beer, wine and whisky was also confiscated at this resort and taken in charge by the officers.Many Complaints ReceivedThe raid upon the Sawtelle resortswas the result of continual complaintby Governor La Grange of the Soldiers\\'home, who informed the district attorney that liquor was being sold withinthe limits of one and one-half milesof the home, contrary to the law.Complaints from the management ofthe Soldiers\\' home have been numerous during the last year and In thattime several shooting and stabbing affrays have occurred, which the management of the home believes wouldhave been avoided had the offendersrot been drunk with liquors bought atblind pigs. Because of this state of affairs the management of the home hasbeen constantly vigilant in aiding theofficers to suppress the illegal traffic.Melerio, who was arrested at theFour Mil« house, was convicted August7 in Justic Young\\'s court of Illegallyselling liquors and was fined $200.While the officers were in Melerio\\'splace, five men were detected in therear room drinking and as the officersstarted out of the house, an old negrowalked in and cooly called for a•dram.\"',\n",

       "  ('\" Curtin quite agreedf with him and the interview ended.9 We have every reason to trust the gentleman from whom we have received thisstory. It will probably be found substantially correct, although there may, of 1course, be errors in detail.rnteresting to Young Ladies.[N. Y. Irerald.JThe nuns of the Order of the Presentationwho are to take charge of St. Michael\\'sschool for girls, on Ninth\\' avenue andThirty-first street, sailed from Queenstown,Ireland, on the 22d nit., in the City ofParis, and are expected hero to morrow.The Sisters of the Presentation devoteo themselves exclusively to the cause of, gratuitous Catholic education, and havelong since established for their Order inIreland, in connection with this all-important work, a national reputation. Theo origin of this religious community is tracedto a rather romantic incident in the life ofMiss Honora Nagle, who was born in 1728at Ballygriffin, on the banks of the Blackwater, in the county of Cork. Her familyp had wealth and social position, and she was 1, sent to Paris to be educated, where she remained after leaving school, entering withe all the ardor of her nature into the frivoa loss amusements of the gay capital of1 fashion. In thekpring of 1750, Mise Nagle,then just twenty-wo, was returning in theearly morning fromn one of the most distinguished salons of Paris, and as her carriagerolled along the still almost deserted streether eye was attracted by a crowd of peopleof the poorer class, who were standin before the unopened door of a parish church,e waiting to be admitted, that they mightb hear mass before going to their day\\'s work.The hard lot of these children of toil madea deep impression upon the generous heartof the young Irish lady, and made herP painfully aware of the vanity and uselessness of her own life, and with noble imI pulse she resolved to seek at once somef object worth living for and to devote herself exclusively to it. With this view shereturned to Ireland, and first openedschools for poor girls in Cork; but finally,in 1777, she established the Order of thePresentation, whose special mission is Catholic education.There are at present fifty convents of thisOrder in Ireland, and the schools of thePresentation rank among the very best inthe land. The Rev. A. J. Donnelly, theI pastor of St. Michael\\'s church, in this city hwent to Ireland last winter for the specialpurpose of procuring the services of these tladies for the education of the girls of hisprisrh. oA specious convent, adjoining the school-.house on Ninth avenue and Thirty-first tstreet, has been fitted up for them, and twithlin two weeks after their arrival theywill probably have under their chargeevery girl of school age in the congregation.It is also quite probable that they will beinvited to open schools in other parts of thearchdiocese. We may, therefore, safely mconclude that the introduction of the Order iof the Presentation is a really important Tevent in connection with Catholic educationin New York. totoA Georgia negro was riding a mule along gcand came to a bridge, when the mule stopped to\"',\n",
